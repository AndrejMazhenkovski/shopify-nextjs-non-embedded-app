## 🚀 Authors & Contributors

The original author of this code is [@carstenlebek](https://github.com/carstenlebek).

When I launched my Shopify app [Notifeed](https://apps.shopify.com/notifeed) using Carsten's original repository, I encountered issues that were also noted by Shopify. Despite opening a pull request and submitting issues, there was no response for over a year, so I've created this soft fork to continue maintenance and improvements over the original repository

#### Updates and Improvements over the original

Since the inception of this soft fork, the first order of business was to update the shopify-api, as it was using an outdated version 3.0.4. Now updated to 7.6.0.

Fixed a bug where the app would load, but not install to the store, shortly after you uninstall it.
