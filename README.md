When I launched my Shopify app [Notifeed](https://apps.shopify.com/notifeed) using Carsten's original repository, I encountered issues that were also noted by Shopify. Despite opening a pull request and submitting issues, there was no response for over a year, so I've created this soft fork to continue maintenance and improvements over the original repository

#### Updates and Improvements over the original

Since the inception of this soft fork, the first order of business was to update the shopify-api, as it was using an outdated version 3.0.4. Now updated to 7.6.0 (2023-07).

Fixed a bug where the app would load, but not install to the store, shortly after you uninstall it.
Fixed a major bug that would not allow switching of apps between multiple stores on the same browser session.

Improved webhooks with callback handler configuration.
